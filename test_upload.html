However, if just a basic ereader will do, get a Nook Simple Touch. It's quite cheap now, plus it can last a long time between battery charges.  I've had a Nook ST for 3+ years, and it can get pretty close to a month between charges, depending on level of use.  Screen resolution is less than on more modern Kindle readers, and it is NOT back-lit, but otherwise, the Nook ST should handle all your basic ereading needs.  It is completely readable even in direct sunlight.  It's light and durable.  I have mine in a soft case to give it extra protection from accidental drops.\n\nThe best thing about the Nook is that it is rootable.  It only uses Android 2.1, so functionality is obviously limited, but once rooted, it can still read all Nook ebooks, plus you can install the Kindle app on it to read Kindle ebooks as well!  That's the best of both worlds, if you have separate books on your Nook or Amazon accounts and want to combine them all together in one device.  You can use a rooted Nook to access the internet via wifi, but keep in mind it uses e-ink, so it will be sluggish, even with Opera Browser installed.  Better to just use the Nook for reading books.", "summary": "The Nook Simple Touch is a great e-reader for basic reading needs!", "unixReviewTime": 1479168000}

This works perfectly just like a real book in the sun, you'll feel as if you are looking at a paper page. I'll get down to the pros/cons.\nPros: lightweight, small, simple, holds hundreds of books, only needs a charge 1-2x month, you can create shelves with books of your choosing.\nCons: only wifi capable, it is simply a reader for books (not great for magazines or anything in color), no web, checking emails, surfing, games etc.\n\nThis will work well for someone who simply wants to read, no frills.

As you may know, space is precious when you're talking about military gear. We were very strict on what we could or could not bring on the deployment. Also I need something that could go a long time on a single charge. None of the full tablets were going to cut it and than I discovered the paper white. It claims that you can go several weeks on a single charge (or was it months) I can't remember since it's been son long. There were times on my last deployments where we went almost a month without any electricity. After a successful deployment I can defiantly say that this nook proved it was up to the task. I don't think I charged it more than twice and the second charge was just because I had the time and means. The tablet was also very well built. As you may know, Iraq has lots of sand. There were even a few times where I dropped the tablet in the sand. The device kept on trucking and did not give up.\n\nAfter my deployment I put it away in a drawer and forgot about it until I discovered it after I recently moved to my new town house. I would recommend this for anyone who want's a cheaper tablet for reading and does not mind not having sound or video. I currently have the finances and the means to get a much fancier and expensive tablet but I still love using my paper white.

I would have to reset my nook, used the \"Go To\" function to skip to the page AFTER the one I wanted to read, and then go back a page just to pick up where I left off. And BN customer service is completely unhelpful when it comes to their slightly older e-readers, because everybody wants you to upgrade to their newest tablet editions with backlit screens. If I wanted to read books on a tablet, I would do that, but what I want is an e-ink ereader specifically for reading books. I have been a nook fan since the beginning and I still totally am.

It had been a steady and faithful (if slightly huge) companion and my first foray into the world of e-books. I tried using the Nook app for my Nexus 7 tablet but unlike the Kindle app, it was unwieldy and rather user-unfriendly. Not to mention needing the internet to actually READ the books I already bought. So I figured it was time to invest in another Nook--the Simple Touch.  No bells and whistles. Just a good, basic touchscreen e-reader with a very clear screen.  It's a fairly light little machine, weighs about the same as my Kindle. There are two aspects that makes Nook superior to Kindle: one is the expandable memory card slot. I've always liked the ability to add e-books from other vendors to my Nook. The second is the ability to customize screensavers.  Yes, it seems like such a minor thing, but I just like the personalization. I'm on Day Two of my new Nook and so far I like it.\n\nUpdate 6/14/15: So far, so good. The battery life is awesome. I do charge it every day but I really don't have to.

I got my nook as a hand-me-down from my girlfriend's father who bought it and almost immediately realized he had no use for it. It's been sitting around the house for about two years now, getting extremely occasional use. Recently I've found myself in a situation where I have to purchase e-books regularly because many of my favorite authors are releasing novellas or short story collections without print versions, and this has come in extremely handy.\n\nNow that I've been using it more, I have to say I'm incredibly impressed by how well this technology that was designed in 2011 holds up today. I have zero complaints about it, hardware or software. I doubt I'll feel even the slightest urge to purchase a newer e-reader until this one bites the dust. The text is clear and crisp. The device itself is lightweight, feels good in the hand, and is pretty much the exact size and shape I would want--not too big, not too small.\n\nThe software works perfectly for how I use it. The touchscreen works better than you'd expect. I've had no issues typing on it in the rare cases where I do need to type, and everything is simple to navigate. One minor touch I love is that when the device sleeps or when you lock it the screen shows a classy black and white drawing of a famous author. I'm sure the Kindle has something similar.\n\nOne thing people might be frustrated by is that you can't just buy a book off Amazon and have it automatically sync over wifi or whispernet like you can with a Kindle. For me, that's not a problem. I rarely buy e-books. Usually, like I said, it's a new novella from a favored author which doesn't happen that frequently. Otherwise it's typically books I got from a humble e-book bundle. Since Amazon wouldn't automatically sync those to a kindle even if I had one, I've settled into using calibri to manage my e-book library and transfer over usb to my nook with the proper metadata and in the proper format (calibri can convert anything to anything and keeps the original intact). For those wondering, you CAN buy the kindle version of an e-book on amazon and get it on your nook using calibri fairly easily. There are guides out there that spell it all out, so just google it.", "summary": "Does Everything I Need", "unixReviewTime": 1429315200}

This means that you can shop Sony's store with a Nook, and Nook's store with a Sony, but Amazon can't access either of those stores.\n\nThe downside to this is that, as of now, Amazon books tend to be cheaper than any other e-reader store.  However, all the ebooks are usually within a dollar or two, and I like having the freedom to go and purchase e books from multiple stores, instead of just being locked into one.\n\nThis is NOT a tablet, and as such, you can't surf the web, download apps, or play games.

Yes, the nook is quicker on the page turning and lighter but I am having too much trouble to appreciate faster and lighter.  I am having an infinite amount of trouble getting library books onto the nook - I've yet to succeed and the problems lie with adobe digital editions.  Why aren't nooks plug and play?  That's my first big problem.  I have no problem with my Sony and the library book I wanted is now on my Sony.  The second is that I like to read while I'm eating my lunch - ereader in left hand and fork in right.  It is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating - the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side.  The Sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center, which is perfect placement.  I read the great reviews on the nook and for the price, I thought it was worth a try.  I'm also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general.  I don't need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they're all offering it now.  I also don't appreciate my registration info being used by B&N as permission to start emailing me crap - I am already unsubscribed from that 'service'.  I'm definitely not happy with the nook and I'm going to save up my money to buy another Sony.\n**UPDATE 5/25/13**  I finally was able to download library books onto my nook but it was frustrating and time consuming; I finally found help online.  I have yet to discover a way to comfortably hold this book in my left hand and turn the page.  This was a very bad buy for me.  I bought a book-style cover for it and that was a waste of money as well as I find the cover just gets in the way.  I did not know how good I had it with the Sony PRS-300 and will continue to use my Sony instead of the nook.

I searched on the Internet and a lot of other people have the same issue. It seems there is a problem with the batteries on these units....

It would be nice for the end user to be able to take the battery out and replace it; I am going to have to send mine back, even though I had to wait a while to get this one and was looking forward to use it, play with it, test it. Ok, so I sent this one back and got the money back, but not the cost to send it back to seller. I bought a second one from another seller. This one powered on, but had other serious issue with it. I tried to insert a micro SD card, but the casing for the card reader was misaligned and my card fell in the device itself. As this could have been labeled as my fault, that I did not pay enough attention to the casing, I did not try to send it back. Plus, I had to take my card out from inside the device somehow. I decided to open the device and forget about warranty to be able to get the card out. I tried to align the casing of the card reader, but instead I managed to break it entirely. The small metal plates broke in one spot and I decided to peel it off completely. I was able to finally put the cover back on the whole device, but without damaging some places of the plastic cover. I figured that 2GB of internal memory would be enough and I would be loading books on it through the USB connector, by connecting to a computer. But it turns out it does not have 2GB available internally to put books on. It only has 250 MB, like other reviewers have mentioned. I do not know if I can root the device without a card reader to put a card in. Have not tried to root it yet, but I read on the internet that it is possible. That would be the obvious solution to many of its software limitations.

That leaves about 250mb for the rest of your library.\nFortunately, a 4gb microSD card cost me a measly $5. Even better, memory card integration is seamless.\nAmazon's got a great price, too. $10 cheaper than anyone else. Ironic, considering the Nook is their direct competitor.\nOne thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook, regardless of font size or line spacing, so you can turn through page 85 two or three times before getting to page 86. It's a little weird, but not a major issue.\nI got my paws on one of these things in the store, and I'm still surprised at how light and small it is.\nThe last consideration (not really an issue, but an odd choice on their part) is the lack of a file manager on the device. You have to plug the Nook into a computer to delete files. However, it's irrelevant, since all of my ebooks are on the memory card, and I bought a USB adapter for that very reason.\nAll in all, this is a fantastic product, and I am very pleased with it.", "summary": "Reach out and Touch someone", "unixReviewTime": 1366070400}

All the books I buy are from Amazon, and so with the nook it won't sync those which is unfortunate.  But where it shines is when I refuse to buy a book because the publishers are being greedy (eg, Dance with Dragons by George RR Martin, game of thrones series...  The ebook costs more than a physical copy.  It even costs more than a physical copy translated into another language!  Give me a break!)  So anyway, when it comes down to piracy to keep the publishers in check - the nook is great.  You plug it into USB, it shows up as a drive on the computer.  You type in the name of a book into google and add \"epub download\" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)  Download that straight to the nook's drive letter and you're done.\n\nThe main reason I wanted it originally, before I found out how incredibly easy the above was, was because of the shape and feel.  I love the shape and feel over the kindle.  But other than that and the simplicity I'd probably go with a kindle for legit purchases (also I'm pretty sure the nook has been officially abandoned by B&N, which will of course make any syncing that may have existed even more problematic in the future.)", "summary": "Great size and feel, great for non-purchased books", "unixReviewTime": 1363996800}

It now seems like fraudulent advertising because I've since read that the MSRP is $79.99\n\nInitially I had serious problems with the Nook, and requested a refund. The seller, BlueProton, refused to take returns or give a refund for it, and directed me to Barnes & Noble who referred me back to the seller, stating  that the seller should refund it within 14 days; at that time  I'd only had it a few days. My Amazon A to Z claim ended with Amazon siding with the seller, BlueProton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on Nooks - something I did not see when I initially read their policy!\n\nBecause neither BlueProton nor Barnes & Noble would take responsibility for the defective product, and their attitude was \"Take the money and run!\", I'm giving the Nook a low review although later I found an update for the Nook which resolved the problems - with no help or information from either seller or Barnes & Noble!\n\nI now enjoy using the Nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading,  and to carry back & forth to work each day or to travel with. I don't like the gray screen which requires you to face the Nook towards the light; and I don't like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights. I have to sit \"just so\" to read it - which somewhat defeats the idea of portability. Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.\n\nMy favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles! Most of my library's digital books are in ePub format which is the native format of the Nook. However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software. Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.\n\nOrdinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once. Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books. The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.\n\nThe pros: the low price; comfort; convenience; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you'll only read once; no clutter of physical books; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in 14 days (automatic returns); ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free Calibre software. The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.\n\nThe cons: PlueProton's and Barnes & Nobles's total lack of responsibility for their defective Nooks - why I gave the Nook such a low rating; Amazon's siding with Blue Proton's irresponsible returns policy; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a response.\n\nOver all I'm pleased with my Nook Simple Touch now that I managed to FIX IT BY MYSELF, but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life.", "summary": "no responsibility from sellers for initially defective  new product", "unixReviewTime": 1361836800}

Just copy the documents to it and open to read them.\nI will NEVER buy these kinds of eBook readers anymore, not even the new Kindle as I heard they will show ads on the screen and the Kindle Fire will just immediately buy stuff from Amazon if I accidently click on some place, IT DOES NOT even show a confirmation screen (too greedy to make money) !!! I don't buy something to read these ads. Amazon and B & N are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like, at the users expense.\n\nI will try to get a new Android tablet instead (for reading, and Internet browsing). Rather spend a few hundreds bugs to get a good product than a cheap one that does not work.\nMany users were lucky to get the ones that work (touch scree sensitivity seems to be the key here), I was not and don't want to try my luck with it again.", "summary": "very clumsy not functional", "unixReviewTime": 1359936000}

I have an iPad but when I do read, sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.  It came down to this, the basic Kindle, and the new Kindle Paperwhite.  When I really thought about it, the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.  I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn't have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses.\n\nIt wasn't quite as straight forward as I was expecting.  I initially thought it'd be like the iPad where you just drag the book into the Books section of iTunes and you're ready to go.  I dragged the books onto the Nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened.  I found out you had to download ADE and set it up that way.  From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.\n\nI also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.  It also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer(I think the Kindle is the same way as well though).\n\nThe reading experience is great though.  Its not too bright and easy on the eyes.  The Nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile.  Library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device.\n\nOverall I am happy with it.  I mentioned its shortcomings, but they don't outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience.  From a reading standpoint I'd give it 5 stars, just some other things that popped up that aren't big deals, but noticable.  I'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't do a ton of reading, but still wants a simple e-reader.  If you are a more serious reader, I'd probably spring for the Paperwhite.", "summary": "Not bad, not great, but satisfied", "unixReviewTime": 1350345600}

Seriously, I've played with the current e-ink Kindles, and the difference in refresh rate might SEEM small on paper, but in practice it's a very noticeable difference.\n\n- I never had the wifi problems others did after the November firmware update, but I understand that the latest firmware update should solve it.\n\n- The NST feels really nice when you're holding it, and I really like that there are physical page turn buttons in addition to the onscreen touch turning - I use both, depending on whether I'm sitting up or lying down when I read, etc.\n\n- Navigation is very intuitive.\n\n- I bought a $5 4gb micro SD card and have had no problems using it with the NST.\n\n- Sideloading non-DRMed, non-B&N content downloaded from places like Project Gutenburg is very easy, and it all goes into the same library as your B&N downloaded content.\n\nCons:\n\n- The user interface is easy to use, but it's also VERY basic, and there are very few features.  You can organize your books into \"shelves,\" but only on the device itself, and it's a cumbersome process.  You can sort books by title, author, and date added, and... that's pretty much it.  The NST isn't a tablet and I don't want it to be, but there are still some pretty simple features that don't seem like it would have been that hard to add, and more flexible organization is one of them.\n\n- Once a book's in the library, you can't really see anything about it besides the title and author. Metadata from sideloaded content doesn't show up, and even purchased content requires you to be on wifi to see more information.\n\nThat's about it. My cons list is really more of a wishlist, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the NST to anyone, especially at the lowered $99 price.

I LOVE THE DISPLAY.  That's it.  A real home run?

I might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet, and that won't be from B+N.\n\nHere are the problems with the whole Nook thing.\n\n(1) You can't use it for a PDF, magazine, or anything with graphics because YOU CANNOT ZOOM OR ROTATE. I have purchased some books with pictures and figures that you can't see.  Guess they want you to get the color tablet-like Nook, huh?  Nope, not going there (see above).\n\n(2) YOU CANNOT SHARE BOOKS. Yeah, yeah, they SAY you can, but that's VERY LIMITED and makes no sense.  (If the publishers trust them enough with their DRM to have the book at all, why can't you transfer the book to someone else using the same DRM?) I can get a paperback, read it, and share it forever.  Not so with Nook and you know it.\n\n(3) B+N (and everybody's) E-BOOKS COST THE SAME AS A NEW PAPERBACK, even though the seller didn't incur any cost of printing, shipping, inventory, etc.  But I can get a paperback for 25% off at my local Kroger grocery store for new releases and best sellers, or I can go down to the used book stores and find quite a few titles at 50% (or more) off list.  When everybody in my family has read that book, I can sell it to the used book store for 15% or 25% of list value.  That's a win-win.\n\nSo, where's the advantage with a Nook other than it's cool?  Three strikes (it could get one more if you count fragility compared to a paperback book).  This whole e-reader thing is bravo-sierra at this point.\n\nThat's my $0.02.

There are many reviews on YouTube and other places that address that point.  The problem with the B&N system is the fact that you must enter a 'default credit card' to be able to use or purchase any books.  If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.  Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.\n\nI tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.  By contrast, with the Kindle system, you simply buy a book through Amazon using any credit card (which does not have to stay active) and send it to an authorized device.  The Nook system, by comparison, is slow, clunky, and a massive security risk.\n\nIf you setup the Nook and do not provide this credit card during setup, no books can be sent to the Nook wirelessly, they must be sync'ed with a cable tethered to a computer.  Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.  Furthermore, it would appear that B&N is entering into a contract with my minor daughter in this regard.  By opting out of this model, you are left with an utterly useless device.\n\nWhy none of the other reviewers elaborate on this is beyond me.  I suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work, however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child, I'd avoid any device related to B&N altogether.\n\nI give them 2 starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device, in this case, is useless.  While you can delete your credit card from B&N, the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.

I didn't realize that if you buy books from B&N, you can only read them on your Nook, and not on anything else.  So even though you paid for them, those books really aren't your property.  You have no access to them if you don't use their products! Still, I liked the fact that it used ePub, and you had a variety of stores you could buy from and also that libraries have more ePub books available.  However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N. If I had known this I never would have bought the Nook. It's as consumer un-friendly as you can get!  Really a nasty way to do business.  Amazon is different.  Once you buy a book, it is yours.  You can read it on any device. When it comes to buying books, Amazon is far easier to use and alot more consumer friendly.  The Kindle is by far a better choice of the two.\nI am returning the Nook after only a week, because this is a frustrating product that doesn't function like it is supposed to do.  There are simply too many glitches in how the touch screen works to be reliable. Here are the cons:  First, it often takes multiple touches to access anything.  You touch or swipe the screen, and nothing happens.  You try it again, and still nothing.  What a joke.  Second, pages turn mysteriously on their own and without warning, both forward and backward.  I am always losing my place when I try to read a book.  I've noticed that this happens almost every time you alter the angle of the Nook.  If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.  Third, the pop-up menu and dictionary are too easy to activate by accident.  If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.  This happens several times an hour.  You can't just simply sit down, relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap. Last of all, it does not use a standard USB/micro USB cable. The USB connection to the computer is standard, but the micro USB connection to the Nook itself is NOT!  It is thinner and wider.  You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.  You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.  So if you need a longer cord, or lose their cord, you're out of luck. Talk about a major inconvenience, one that makes zero sense!  Pros: I did like that it recharges in under 4 hours and that it has a very long battery life.", "summary": "Not consumer friendly, full of glitches", "unixReviewTime": 1325203200}

This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire. This device is designed to read books, and it does a beautiful job at it. I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it, but it was way too difficult, and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad. Like the Sony reader, the nook can take notes but wouldn't be a great device to purchase for that purpose.\nIt was pretty easy to set up- I didn't read the instruction manual, but I usually don't. I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet, my barnes and noble account, and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books. I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet, but that has happened with every new device I've purchased, so I think its my internet's fault, not the nook. I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked.\nI really like holding it to read- I generally read ridiculously thick books, so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that I have to prop up (and its so much nicer to read from than an iPad- the iPad is fine to read from, and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue, but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand). Initially I didn't realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back, so I was touching the screen each time- the delay time is a bit longer that way, and it was annoying to have to use both hands. As soon as I realized that the buttons existed, the experience got even better.\nThe battery life seems great- I charged it all the way up using my usb-to-outlet power adapter that I have for my iphone/ipad, and it worked great. I haven't had to charge it again, and I've been reading for about an hour each day.\nThe one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldn't load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn't enough room. The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads. A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble. Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that. I popped it in, turned the device off and on, and I was ready to go again. Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.\nKindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources. Yes, its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people won't be interested in. I would have purchased the kindle with special offers, and hadn't thought much about it, but I've enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen, and would probably get annoyed by the commercials/make a point to put my nook in a case so I didn't have to see them.\nDurability- I haven't abused it by any stretch of the imagination- yet- but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didn't crack/break/show any sort of damage\nI'll update my review as I have more time to play with it in the next few months", "summary": "Great purchase- you won't regret it", "unixReviewTime": 1323388800}

Contrast on the display was a big problem for me, and I wasn't especially keen that the Kindle uses a proprietary book format that cannot be read on other e-readers. So, as long as I stuck buying books from Amazon for a Kindle, I was fine; the second I ever wanted to move to another device, I couldn't take my books. This didn't sit well with me.\n\nWhen Barnes and Noble dropped the price of the Nook Simple Touch to $99 I decided to take the plunge. (Note that as of this writing, Amazon still has not reflected the price drop.) The newer generation screen, while still not perfect, is far, far superior than earlier generations. Reading indoors no longer requires a spotlight on the e-reader to maintain legibility. Anyone who owns an iPad or other tablet knows how intuitive a touch interface can be, so I'm delighted to say that the navigation issues previously posed by the joystick on the older Kindle are resolved with the Nook's new touch interface.\n\nAmazon released their own Touch e-reader just recently. While it now brings the Kindle in line with the capabilities of the Nook, it still lags in one area: proprietary book format. The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books. Amazon for its own reasons chooses not to. What this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from Amazon - and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another e-reader is the better platform for you.\n\nI refuse to be a party to that kind of lock-in, which is why I am very happy with my Nook Simple Touch.", "summary": "A Very Pleasant Surprise", "unixReviewTime": 1321401600}

Well I decided to buy the Nook and I'm very, very pleased. I won't go into an in depth review of the device itself. You can find that just about anywhere.

The Franklin eBookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer.  The Ectaco Jetbook Lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well, plus an extremely user-unfriendly upgrade method.\n\nI did encounter one major problem with this Nook Simple Touch -- the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised (with wifi off).  Fortunately, however, I called B&N Customer Service, and they advised me to install the latest firmware, V1.0.1, which addresses the power issue.\n\nThe upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches, and it seems to have solved the problem; though I haven't put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet, the charge indicator is holding at 100% after a full day, including more than an hour of reading.  That compares very favorably to the 83% discharge rate I had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware.  I will report back if the battery problem returns.\n\nOtherwise I prefer the Nook Simple Touch's ergonomics to the comparable Kindle.  The Nook's front is all screen, with no unnecessary keyboard keys.  Virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something.  The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.\n\nThere are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.  You have a choice of font styles and sizes, and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight.  You can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition (provided, I found, that the word isn't hyphenated and run on two lines).\n\nI like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library (you download to Adobe Digital Reader, which your library provides free, and then transfer the Epub books to your Nook with the USB cable provided).  The program recognized my Nook without any glitches.\n\nI also like being able to read any book for an hour a day FREE at the nearby B&N store.\n\nNewbies should note that, in their apparent effort to keep the NST instructions short and simple, B&N left out a few useful ones.  Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter \"library.\"  To lock the Nook immediately, without waiting for it to enter sleep mode, press the power button on the back briefly.  And to tell when the Nook has finished charging, wait for the little LED next to the USB input on the unit to turn from amber to green.\n\nSo if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics, take a look at this Nook.  But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!)\n\nUPDATE: Trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader -- or perhaps they find me.  At any rate, I bought a copy of the American Heart Association Cookbook (7th Edition) and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marks!\n\nI emailed B&N Customer Support, and they suggested that I try downloading the title again (which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title, whatever that means).  That didn't work, but I found that if I clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked \"Publisher's Default\" (or words to that effect), that seemed to solve the problem.  So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!\n\nI sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!", "summary": "The Right Touch", "unixReviewTime": 1314489600}

While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!\n\nNow here comes the Nook Simple Touch Reader (Nook STR). I got one via pre-order when they came out in early June.  It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook STR, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the \"slide to unlock\" feature like the iPhone. The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine. I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.\n\nIn response to the reviews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond, the pre-order Nook STR I had suffered from that problem.  The touchscreen would become slow to respond, and eventually quit working altogether.  A power cycle generally brought it back.  I started a thread on B&N's website about this and found many others having the problem.  I did take my Nook STR back to B&N and they exchanged it.  Have had the replacement Nook ST for six weeks now and the problem hasn't returned.  So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.\n\nGoing back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).  This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.\n\nThe Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.  Using the device is easy enough, but loading books from a library website (via Adobe Digital Editions) requires a few steps to complete.  If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.\n\nOne last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the \"Shop\" tab to access B&Ns website.  Every Friday B&N offers a free book for download, and has discounts on other days of the week.", "summary": "Simple (To Use) Touch Reader", "unixReviewTime": 1311465600}

Charlotte", "reviewText": "Just a short review of my two weeks with the Nook Simple Touch.  This looked the the reader to get when it came out.  Specifically for me the touch screen was a must.  I enjoyed reading on it everyday until I returned it.  It was light and extremely easy to navigate with its touch screen.  What happened though, was on about the 12th day while using it the touch screen stopped responding.  I couldn't turn a page with the screen or pull up a menu with the screen or do anything else.  And, when I shut it off and turned it back on I couldn't swipe the screen to get into the book - I was completely stuck...locked out.  Finally after fiddling with it after about 15 minutes it started to work again.  I went on the web and found out that others had this same thing happen to them so I decided to return it rather then hope for a fix (I was still within my 14 days return policy).", "summary": "Good reader, has some problems.", "unixReviewTime": 1310774400}

In the past month alone, I have made at least 12 purchases.  I was browsing around just now and decided to see what Amazon.com customers thought of my newest electronic device.  I was thrilled to see the high rating, but disappointed to see the price; $40.00 more than the thing costs at B/N since its release last month.  Amazon, you need to do better here!\n\nNow to the product - This is my first e-reader and I am certain that I went with the best product for me.  As someone who buys a lot of books from Amazon, I would have preferred to have bought the Kindle,especially since Amazon has more of the types of books I read and for much cheaper than B/N, but I just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device.  I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.  B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.  My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.\n\nThe touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile \"buttons\" that will allow you to change pages.  The home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library, and some suggested readings.  You can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories. They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.\n\nWithout going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.  Some people buy this expecting it to browse the web (although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack) - Play their audio files, when there is not headphone jack (Techies have discovered that it DOES have built-in bluetooth, however), and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color.  It is not meant to do that - it is meant to be solely an enjoyable easy-to-use reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand, READING!\n\nThis is why I bought it - Eventually, I will get a nook color - or a Kindle *color* if they come out with one, but for now, I thoroughly  enjoy my Nook, which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful, leisurely act of reading. In my excitement, I am reading like 8 different books at once.  That is the great joy of having an e-reader - speaking to those who are, just as I used to be, resistant to the e-reading craze - there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books, and when I get tired of reading one, another book is just a couple of swipes away. I am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost, as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and e-book management tools such as Calibre.  I am having a blast with this thing!\n\nYesterday, I received a nice leather case for it that I purchased off Ebay for a great price.  Once again, I looked to Amazon.com first, but there simply were not good options.  I got a black leather Caseen case that also came with a screen protector for twenty bucks.", "summary": "Really, Amazon? It only costs $139.00 at  B/N!", "unixReviewTime": 1310601600}

Williams", "reviewText": "First let me qualify my comments.  If you are looking for an all purpose ePad or IPAD alternative, buy another product!  That's clearly not what Barnes and Noble designed this unit for.  It's not intended to surf the web, check email, etc.  It is an eReader...PERIOD!\n\nHaving said that, in my opinion, it is the best out there right now.  It is incredibly light weight - much lighter than even a typical paperback.  It is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book.  The clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an LCD type display is after a few hours.\n\nThe battery life is insane.  If you turn off WIFI, which should be normal unless you are looking for another book, the battery doesn't need recharging for weeks on end.  Page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen.  Assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press.  I found most of the time I don't use them.\n\nIt has a very responsive touch screen for all your navigation.  I had a 1st generation Nook and this one is far easier to navigate through books which is a big plus for Bibles or Reference books.  It reads ePub format so more than half of what I read comes from the public library.\n\nIt is not going to be great for color magazines and so on.  You will need a Nook Color or an ePad like Xoom or IPAD for that.  But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.\n\nOne nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.  If you come across a word you are unfamiliar with you just touch it and up pops an option look it up.  I think Barnes and Noble has a winner here.", "summary": "Great eReader in Every Respect", "unixReviewTime": 1310515200}

It felt like the early days of the internet, with textual interfaces, underlined words, fiddling with buttons and keyboard to navigate, and all sorts of annoyances that got in the way of reading and enjoying the device. We returned it within 3 days.\n\nNext we tried the original Nook Black&White, and interface was much better, but the screen had poor contrast. (not the nice Pearl screen as the Kindle has)\n\nEnter Nook Touch.  WOW.  This thing has a top notch interface... they totally put their minds and heart into this one...  it is PERFECT.  Touchscreen makes a world of a difference, and enables the slick interface that allows you to browse the store, personal library, and more.  On-screen Buttons and finger gestures make the magic happen, and this is one device you are sure to LOVE TO USE.  The screen is the new Pearl, so it looks just as good as the Kindle, with the added benefit of touchscreen!\n\nThe size?  PERFECT!  Not too big, not too small.  Very thin.  Well built.  Feels durable.\n\nAll I can say is this is finally the ereader I've been waiting for...  excellent battery life, good Pearl screen, touchscreen, and perfect size.\n\nTo boot, the price is dead on!  $139 with Wifi.  If it gets stolen, I am buying another one immediately!", "summary": "A real pleasure to use this device!  Finally!", "unixReviewTime": 1310428800}
