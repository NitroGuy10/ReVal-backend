Page turns are not instantaneous and there is a weird, albeit brief flash of the screen every time I change pages. The page turn is actually faster on my first edition. I was also having issues with some books where I received an error when I tried to turn the page, almost like the page didn't exist. I would have to reset my nook, used the \"Go To\" function to skip to the page AFTER the one I wanted to read, and then go back a page just to pick up where I left off. And BN customer service is completely unhelpful when it comes to their slightly older e-readers, because everybody wants you to upgrade to their newest tablet editions with backlit screens. If I wanted to read books on a tablet, I would do that, but what I want is an e-ink ereader specifically for reading books. I have been a nook fan since the beginning and I still totally am. I really want to love this, but until BN works out their software issues, I just can't.", "summary": "Really wanted to love this.", "unixReviewTime": 1453939200},

I love the battery life, the simplicity and the size of the device.  I can go for weeks without charging it, I can download books within seconds.  The best part is the size and weight of the device.  I can hold it for hours and read without getting hand cramps.  I also love the e-ink display so much more than a back lit screen.  I have an iPad mini, an ipad 4 and several other devices but none of them can hold a candle to the Nook Simple Touch Reader.  It irritates me that Barnes and Noble doesn't actively sell them because in my opinion it's the best e-reader available.", "summary": "I absolutely love the Simple Touch Reader by Nook", "unixReviewTime": 1445904000},
