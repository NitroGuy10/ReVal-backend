The resulting power surge (208 volts to be precise) fried several of our electronic items connected to these power strips. We had other sensitive electronics (including a laptop and a pair of Samsung tablets) plugged into cheaper, competing brand surge protectors. Nothing else was damaged.\n\nI wasn't too worried about this because of Monster's $150,000 protection guarantee. That was a mistake. After calling and speaking with a friendly customer service agent, Rodrigo Chavez, I was instructed to email a copy of the invoice where I purchased the power centers. That took a while due to various electronics being fried, but I did do so about a week later.  Mr. Arturo Castro responded quickly with this:\n\n\"Thank You for the receipt, unfortunately the store factory depot is not listed as an authorized dealer, we won't be able to proceed with your warranty claim.\n\n You case is canceled.\n\n We are sorry for the inconvenience.\"\n\nNow, no where in the ad for this on Amazon.com did they mention that only certain dealers could be used for this warranty to be valid. These were purchased new. The last human being to touch them was someone who worked for Monster. Luckily for me, I live in a country where lies told by corporations are excused by lawyers who politely twist anything to the profit of their corporate masters.\n\nBut, they do feel really bad about it as they take my money and run.

First of all, this product sells for between $70-130 on other sites so $50 is an excellent price for this. Not only was this a great way to clean up all of the power cords connected to my television but there are several other benefits to this product.  The first thing I liked about it is that the plugs are labeled so that you know which plug your tv, dvd/blu ray, cable, etc. are plugged into on the unit. You don't have to play with the wires to figure out which plug belongs to which unit.  There are also 2 \"accessory\" plugs on the top and bottom of the powercenter, which I personally used to plug my soundbar and speaker into.  Another great feature is that the plug's are actually along the side of the powercenter intend of the front, which is another convenient way to keep everything neat and tidy.  The powercenter can be mounted on a wall, which I personally did and it was very easy. You screw in the mounting bracket to the wall and then just slide the powercenter onto the hooks on the mounting bracket.  This is a great way to keep the powercenter in place and allow the plugs to sit nicely in place and not get tangled or twisted on the floor.  Lastly, the protection and power benefits of this product are the added bonus you don't get with a normal power cord.  The lights on the front of the power center confirm that the grounding wire and other connections are working correctly and the surge protection ensures that my electronics are safe.  All of these benefits makes this product better than other options and well worth the cost.

The repairman noticed the surge protector and said, \"Well I see you have a really good surge protector - that's excellent.\" That made me happy with my purchase.\n\nI read a comment below saying that running the cable through the protector could filter cable updates but the repairman specifically said that I should run cable lines through the surge protector as power surges can be transmitted that way. As soon as the B/O'd board is replaced I plan on doing that. I'll report back as to whether or not the cable updates are affected.\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, all but 2 of the plugs go on one side of the unit.

This works well, because I can pull the cabinet away and all of the power cords stay where I put them.

Eventually I decided to put a little effort into organizing and beautifying the mess of cords and cables that goes into a modern 5.1 HT setup. I bought this unit as much for the overall look as for the Monster name, and wasn't disappointed when it arrived- it's the best-looking surge protector on the market. (granted, that's not much of a horse race, but still...) Unfortunately, there's one (easily remedied) problem. The HTS850 comes with a large bracket that wraps around both the back and side of the protector. If you mount the unit to the wall, the bracket is very visible on the side, so you're looking at a large piece of molded plastic with some mounting holes. Given the care that went into the rest of the design, that's a pretty big flaw. The solution was to cut the visible side of the bracket off with a Dremel tool before mounting the bracket to the wall.\n\nOther than that little hiccup, setup was as easy as one would expect. A side benefit of having all the plugs enter on the same side is that cable management is much easier to achieve- I bundled all my power cords neatly with Velcro ties and the result looks fantastic. The HTS850 does show its age a little in the labeling of the plugs (VCR? Really? What, no label for your Victrola?) and the lack of Ethernet connections, but that's not a big deal. Does the \"Clean Power\" circuitry work? I dunno. My picture looked pretty darn good before and it looks pretty darn good now. Is the blue light a distraction? Not really, but I have mine set up where the TV blocks it. I can see where it might be a little annoying otherwise- it's pretty bright. All in all, I paid a reasonable price for something that offers peace of mind while scratching an annoying aesthetic itch in my HT system.

This causes a state of flux for the power running your delicate electronic devices, lowering the performance of the audio/video as well as causing damage to the components. Other conditions such as power outages and lightning strikes only increase this fluctuation. Proper connection to an advanced surge protector that offers integrated system protection can help minimize the risk of permanent surge damage...\"\n\nNow, come on guys, a surge or spike is NOT going to cause your lights to dim, if anything they will brighten. A sag will cause dimming. If this thing could prevent you from feeling the effects of a power sag, it would be very good, but it would also be an UPS or a big mother SOLA transformer...and it's not. This is just a surge supressor, like many others, and certainly well worth having, but it will help not at all with very annoying sags, as Monster implies.", "summary": "OK, but beware of usual Monster hype", "unixReviewTime": 1297209600}

We had recently purchased a Panasonic Blu-Ray player and have a Panasonic hi-def plasma television and decided it would be prudent to protect this equipment. Frequent power surges, brief power outages, and lightning strikes have ruined a lot of our appliances over time, so we probably need all the protection we can get.\n\nA main problem people comment on is plugging in the plugs.  I agree!  I have  some advice.  We had to hook it up to multiple things - the wall, the TV, the DVD player, the receiver for the speakers, the cable box, and a couple of other things.\n\n Here is my advice.  It is hard to get the coaxial cables plugged in, even with small fingers.  After testing to be sure where every cord was coming from (and therefore needed to be plugged into), I would label all the cords and cables with the provided labels.  Plug/connect them in in the following order:  We used the second bank of coaxial connectors only, and we had 2 to go in side by side.  Put in the cable closest to the flange overhang that projects right behind them (and the reason it is so hard to get them in) first.  Then get that second one in.  Then you can plug in the bulky 3 prong plug to the right of those two coaxial cables, and the rest are no problem. It helped to have two people, I have smaller fingers but my husband is stronger, so I held the cords upright while he screwed them in. I am certain he would have manged this himself, but it would have taken longer. We learned this method by trial and error.\n\nI was also a bit disturbed to read in the booklet that came with the unit that you should unplug the power center in the event of a lightning storm.  Unplug?  We thought that was what it was for! I talked to a tech person at Monster and he told me that it is in fact, not necessary to do this, that if you are not home and cannot unplug it, it should save your equipment.  If it does not, you are given the coverage up to $150,000. He did say they still recommend that you unplug all this stuff during a lightning storm, as that is a sure means of protection, but that in fact you can leave it plugged in.  I'm still not sure why, but at least I got my basic question answered\n\nSo far, so good.", "summary": "Monster Cable Home Theater Power Center - some advice", "unixReviewTime": 1245974400}
